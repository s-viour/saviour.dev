The notebook is a statically generated site powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). This little collection of files should be simple and robust enough to let me document pretty much anything I want, be it classical blog posts, writeups on stuff I'm working on, or even school notes.  

This site is pretty heavily inspired by Devine Lu Linvega's [XXIIVV](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/home.html), which is described as "a digital playground and personal logging system".

As of right now, there's not much else to say.
