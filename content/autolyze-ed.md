I developed this little tool to do my ACT-prep work for me in highschool on the website [analyze-ed](https://analyze-ed.com). Just input your username and password into the on-screen prompts and select and-and-all sections you want the tool to finish. Leave this tab open while it runs.

If you're crazy, and want **every** section on the website finished, use [this](/0004) version of the tool instead.
